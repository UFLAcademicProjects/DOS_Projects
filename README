Instructions to run the project
The attached tar contains a folder which contains all the scala files and the libraries needed to run the folder.
project1.scala is the main file to run the project.
Please run the project using scala 2.11.2

Extract the project folder.

Go to bin folder of scala 2.11.2 and run below commands to run server/master program
./scalac -cp "<Project_folder_path>/Lib/*:." <Project_folder_path>/src/*.scala
 /usr/bin/time -p ./scala -cp "<Project_folder_path>/Lib/*:." project1 <no_of_zeros>

Go to bin folder of scala 2.11.2 and run below commands to run client/worker program
./scalac -cp "<Project_folder_path>/Lib/*:." <Project_folder_path>/src/*.scala
 /usr/bin/time -p ./scala -cp "<Project_folder_path>/Lib/*:." project1 <ip_address_server>

Results

Size of the work unit that you determined results in best performance for
your implementation and an explanation on how you determined it. Size
of the work unit refers to the number of sub-problems that a worker gets
in a single request from the boss.

----> We got best results for the work unit of 25000. We kept a count of number of records processed per second by each worker and for 25000 we got the most number of processed records.
Results for this are given below.
