What is working -

Join is working i.e. when a new node joins, state tables of the related nodes in the network are updated.

Route is working i.e. when a destination is chosen, message is routed in O( log n base 16 ) steps.

What is the largest network you managed to deal with -

We could manage to deliver all the messages with 1000 nodes with 10 messages sent by every node.
